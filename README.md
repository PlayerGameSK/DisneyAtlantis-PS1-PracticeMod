# Disney's Atlantis: The Lost Empire (PS1) Practice Mod
A practice mod for the PS1 version of Disney's Atlantis: The Lost Empire. Made primarily for the purpose of speedrun practice on PS2, but should work on any other platform capable of running PS1 games including emulators.
[This page is WIP]

## Functionality:
1. Save your Character's Current Position (**L2 + Triangle**)
2. Load your Character's Current Position (**R2 + Triangle**)
   *(neither of the above works for the level Truck Escape due to its nature)*
4. Automatically jump from the Title Screen to the Level Select, useful if there's no Save Game to load (**L1 + L2 + R1 + R2**)
5. Unlock All Levels (**L3 + R3 on the Level Select screen**)
6. Reset the state of All Collectibles (**Select button on the Level Select screen**)
7. Start New Game from the Level Select (**Hold Square while pressing X on Whitmore's Mansion**)
8. Infinite Health / Lives toggle (During Gameplay: **R3 + L2 to Enable / R3 + R2 to Disable**)
9. Restart the Current Level (**L3 + R3 during Gameplay**)
10. Return to Level Select (**Triangle + L3 + R2**, counts as finishing the level so it brings you to the Save Screen first)
11. Stage Select for Outer Atlantis (**Press either Square or Circle while Outer Atlantis is highlighted in the Level Select** to pick between its pre-Inner or post-Inner state)
12. Insta-Kill Leviathan (**Press Circle** at any time during the boss fight)
13. Infinite Gas in Truck Escape toggle (While in Truck Escape, **press Select to Enable and Circle to Disable, also works while Paused**)
